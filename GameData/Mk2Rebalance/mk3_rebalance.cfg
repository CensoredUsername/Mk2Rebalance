//
// reduce the drag coefficient of the XN/XP/ZN/ZP faces (left/right/top/bottom) to be in line with the normal
// cylindrical fuel tanks. Due to the small amount of geometry changed between them and the circular tanks
// they end up having significantly more drag. This is especially ridiculous on the top/bottom faces
// which should by all account produce less drag than the equivalent cylindrical tanks because they
// literally have the same geometry in the centre, and a small sliver of side removed, but instead
// they get literally 3 times the drag.

//
// as you can see, the average XP/XN coefficients of mk3 tanks are 0.813, compared to the tanks having 0.76. Meanwhile the ZN/ZP faces have 0.83 versus 0.75 again. Particularly funny here is that the side with the flat side facing it is more aerodynamic than the cuved top/bottom sides.
