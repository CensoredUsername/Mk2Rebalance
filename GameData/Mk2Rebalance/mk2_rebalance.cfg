// this changelist attempts to rebalance mk2 parts to be more

// increase mass by ~60% (~30% for 1.25 adapters, both rounded to 10kg)
// increase fuel / oxidizer by 60% (30% for 1.25 adapters)
//
// reduce/zero drag coefficient of the ZP/ZN faces as the wing module already takes care of
// most of that.
// whenver a part has a ModuleLiftingSurface, we reduce
// ZP/ZN drag coefficient to ~0.72
// if it hasn't got one, we reduce it to ~0.74 (causing it to be nearly equivalent to a 1.875m tank)
// oh, and open cargo bays get a nice 0.9 if they're open next to their lifting surface so they aren't
// MORE aerodynamic when they're open. (yes, seriously. I tested it. If they were empty
// mk2 payload bays were more aerodynamic when flying at an angle open than closed)
